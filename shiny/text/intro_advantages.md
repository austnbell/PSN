We identify three key benefits in this line of work: 
  1. Visualization without dimensionality reduction
  2. Easy projection of new patients
  3. Noise reduction in downstream tasks 
  
Patient Similarity Networks are formed via comparing pairwise patient similarity across
multiple measures. By leveraging similarity, we utilize a measure in line with human intuition
lending itself to highly interpretable results. Within each of or pre-defined data
subgroups, we can explore patient 'separability' and key drivers to this separability. 
Essentially, the networks enable us to visualize our data without dimensionality 
reduction techniques. Therefore, providing a more nuanced understanding of how each of
our individual variables may lead to the development of each cluster.

 
Decision makers may be interested in how a new patient compares to the underlying
population. With similarity networks, all that is required is to compute similarity
between the new patient and the existing population. Once calculated, the new patient
can be projected onto the network and comparisons can be explored through intuitive
visualizations. 


Finally, identifying unique subpopulations of data enables us to reduce noise and
improve our understanding of downstream results.  We show that without significant
loss of model efficacy, we gain deeper understanding of our prediction tasks.
