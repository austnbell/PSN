We identify three key benefits in this application: 
  1. Interpretable Visualization
  2. Interactive patient cluster / subpopulation selection
  2. Immediate outcome measurement of subpopulations
  
Patient Similarity Networks are formed via comparing pairwise patient similarity across
multiple 'data subgroups' and combining into a single network. The user can explore 
how patients are clustered within the whole network or within each of these data subgroups 
(e.g., demographics, blood tests). If a patient appears next to another patient within the 
network, it implies similarity across the selected data subgroup. 

While two clusters are pre-identified across the whole network, users can identify subpopulations
within each of these data subgroups. They are able to then select a set of patients and evaluate - for example,
if you see that there is a small cluster forming within demographics, you can select this cluster
and determine what makes this unique (i.e., why are they clustered)

In real-time, the application then evaluates the selected patient subpopulation across a variety
of outcomes. In the case of this application, I identify the key features for determining mortality
in 30 days and perform a survival analysis.
