The following method is followed for this analysis:
  * Identify all patients with Chronic Liver Disease
  * Extract relevant data subgroups (e.g., all tests related to blood)
  * Measure patient pairwise similarity across all subgroups
  * Combine similarity to form the similarity networks 
  * Measure intra-cluster similarities and inter-cluster differences
  * Evaluate efficacy of clusters on downstream prediction tasks 
  * Interactive visualization
