This page displays the results of the subtyping analysis using patient similarity networks. 
It includes:
  * the similarity network highlighted by assigned cluster
  * results of statistical tests comparing numeric and categorical variables between the
  selected cluster and the rest of the population


User options:
  * Select which data subgroup to view. 
    * This subsets the network and the statistical tests to just the selected subgroups 
	* The user can then explore the topology within each subgroup and utilize the below statistical 
	measurements to identify which are the key drivers of this particular topology. 
	
	
	
	
  * Select the primary cluster.  
    * The primary cluster's data is then denoted as "cluster" within
  the statistical test tables, the rest of the populations is denoted as "other"
