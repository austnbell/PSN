This application allows users to interactively explore patient subpopulations in patients diagnosed with chronic liver disease.
First, we identify two core clusters within our patient similarity network, the default setting across all 
tabs then compares these two clusters. Next, the user can explore different similarity networks across different 
data subgroups and select which set of patient 'nodes' that they would like to evaluate.  Selecting a subset
of patients will flow through the rest of the application such that the user can measure what is unique about 
the selected subgroup and how do they experience different outcomes. 

Through leveraging similarity networks, we offer an interpretable alternative to exploring patient subpopulations. 


Underlying this work is the MIMIC-III public EMR database. I focus my analysis on patients with Chronic
Liver Diseases including Cirrhosis, Hepatitis, and others.
