In this project, I focus on the use of patient similarity networks for identifying patient subpopulations.
There are three objectives:
  * Explore interpretable subtyping algorithms 
  * Verify that these algorithms are effective in downstream tasks
  * Provide a nice user interface for domain experts to explore results with 
  
Underlying this work is the MIMIC-III public EMR database. I focus my analysis on patients with Chronic
Liver Diseases including Cirrhosis, Hepatitis, and others. 

As of now, our algorithm uncovered two key phenotypes identified as clusters 0 and 1. 
This dashboard will provide you with the tools to measure what makes these two 
subpopulations unique.
