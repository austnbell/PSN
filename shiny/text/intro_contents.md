This applications consists of two other tabs:
  1. Networks 
  2. 30-day Mortality
  
The Networks tab enables the user to explore intra-cluster similarities
and the inter-cluster differences by each of the defined subgroups on the right. 
Users can explore the topology of each data subgroup, but also observe which 
variables are statistically different across the subgroups. 

The 30-day Mortality tab displays results on the downstream prediction task
to identify which patients will die within 30 days of their last hospital admission. 
We show that despite each subpopulation's model containing significantly less data,
we do not experience any significant drop off in predictive power.
