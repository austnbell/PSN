This applications consists of two other tabs:
  1. Networks 
  2. 30-day Mortality
  3. Survival Analysis
  
The Networks tab enables the user to explore intra-cluster similarities
and the inter-cluster differences by each of the defined subgroups on the right. 
Users can explore the topology of each data subgroup, but also observe which 
variables are statistically different across the subgroups. The user can 
also select smaller groups of patient subpopulations to explore 

The 30-day Mortality tab displays results on the downstream prediction task
to identify which patients will die within 30 days of their last hospital admission. 
Selecting nodes in the Networks tab will identify the set of features that are important
in mortality prediction for the selected subpopulation

The Survival Analysis tab displays results for a survival analysis applied to the
total population and across each cluster. Selecting nodes within the Networks tab
will run a survival analysis for the selected subpopulation
